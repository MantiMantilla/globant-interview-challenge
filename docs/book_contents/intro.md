# Globant Interview Challenge

This documentation site serves as a reference to the implementation details of my take on Globant's code challenge for a Data Engineering job. Particularly, we outline the cloud architecture of implemented and intended or pending services, the inner workings of these APIs and services, and a developer's guide to deployment and documenting.
